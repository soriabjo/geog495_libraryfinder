# Washington State Library Finder

## Project Description
For our final project we have built a sort data by distance application to allow our users to identify nearby libraries to their location at the University of Washington.  We have included a web map that locates all the libraries in the state of Washington. The base map that we created for our application has a monochrome theme that highlights the streets. We have then included our libraries in point format as a layer on top of the base map. Each library has an icon that distinguishes the main purpose of each library. Hovering over each library will display a popup of the library containing information such as its phone contact number, their website, long/lat location, city, county, and any other relevant information that helps our intended audience better choose the library for their needs. There is a search bar in the upper left hand corner of the map that allows users to type in their address and discover the library that is closest to them. Once a user types in and selects their address the map will zoom to their address and show the highlighted library that is closest to them with information on that library.
